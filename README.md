# Jupyter Notebook Viewer

Jupyter nbviewer is the web application behind [The Jupyter Notebook Viewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org), which is graciously hosted by [Rackspace](https://developer.rackspace.com/?nbviewer=awesome).

Run this locally to get most of the features of nbviewer on your own network.

If you need help using or installing Jupyter Notebook Viewer, please use the [jupyter/help](https://github.com/jupyter/help) issue tracker. If you would like to propose an enhancement to nbviewer or file a bug report, please [open an issue here, in the jupyter/nbviewer project](https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer).

## Quick Run

If you have `docker` installed, you can pull and run the currently built version of the Docker container by

```shell
$ docker pull jupyter/nbviewer
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 jupyter/nbviewer
```

It automatically gets built with each push to `master`, so you'll always be able to get the freshest copy.

For speed and friendliness to GitHub, be sure to set `GITHUB_OAUTH_KEY` and `GITHUB_OAUTH_SECRET`:

```shell
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -e 'GITHUB_OAUTH_KEY=YOURKEY' \
                          -e 'GITHUB_OAUTH_SECRET=YOURSECRET' \
                          jupyter/nbviewer
```

Or to use your GitHub personal access token, you can set just `GITHUB_API_TOKEN`.


## GitHub Enterprise

To use nbviewer on your own GitHub Enterprise instance you need to set `GITHUB_API_URL`.
The relevant [API endpoints for GitHub Enterprise](https://developer.github.com/v3/enterprise/) are prefixed with `http://hostname/api/v3`.
You must also specify your `OAUTH` or `API_TOKEN` as explained above.  For example:

```shell
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -e 'GITHUB_OAUTH_KEY=YOURKEY' \
                          -e 'GITHUB_OAUTH_SECRET=YOURSECRET' \
                          -e 'GITHUB_API_URL=https://ghe.example.com/api/v3/' \
                          jupyter/nbviewer
```

With this configured all GitHub API requests will go to your Enterprise instance so you can view all of your internal notebooks.

## Local Development

### With Docker

You can build a docker image that uses your local branch.


#### Build

```shell
$ cd <path to repo>
$ docker build -t nbviewer .
```


#### Run

```shell
$ cd <path to repo>
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 nbviewer
```

### With Docker Compose

The Notebook Viewer uses `memcached` in production. To locally try out this
setup, a [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) configuration is
provided to easily start/stop the `nbviewer` and `memcached` containers
together from a your current branch. You will need to install `docker` prior
to this.

#### Run

```shell
$ cd <path to repo>
$ pip install docker-compose
$ docker-compose up
```


### Local Installation

The Notebook Viewer requires several binary packages to be installed on your system. The primary ones are `libmemcached-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev pandoc libevent-dev`. Package names may differ on your system, see [salt-states](https://github.com/rgbkrk/salt-states-nbviewer/blob/master/nbviewer/init.sls) for more details.

If they are installed, you can install the required Python packages via pip.

```shell
$ cd <path to repo>
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Static Assets

Static assets are maintained with `bower` and `less` (which require having
`npm` installed), and the `invoke` python module.

```shell
$ cd <path to repo>
$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
$ npm install
$ invoke bower
$ invoke less [-d]
```

This will download the relevant assets into `nbviewer/static/components` and create the built assets in `nbviewer/static/build`.

Pass `-d` or `--debug` to `invoke less` to create a CSS sourcemap, useful for debugging.


#### Running Locally

```shell
$ cd <path to repo>
$ python -m nbviewer --debug --no-cache
```

This will automatically relaunch the server if a change is detected on a python file, and not cache any results. You can then just do the modifications you like to the source code and/or the templates then refresh the pages.


#### Running the Tests

`nose` is used to run the test suite. The tests currently make calls to
external APIs such as GitHub, so it is best to use your Github API Token when
running:

```shell
$ cd <path to repo>
$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
$ GITHUB_API_TOKEN=<your token> python setup.py test
```


## Extending the Notebook Viewer
### Providers
Providers are sources of notebooks and directories of notebooks and directories.

`nbviewer` ships with several providers
- `url`
- `gist`
- `github`
- `local`

#### Writing a new Provider
There are several already additional providers
[proposed/requested](https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aprovider). Some providers are more involved than others, and some,
such as those which would require user authentication, will take some work to
support properly.

A provider is implemented as a python module, which can expose a few functions:

##### `uri_rewrites`
If you just need to rewrite URLs (or URIs) of another site/namespace, implement
`uri_rewrites`, which will allow the front page to transform an arbitrary string
(usually an URI fragment), escape it correctly, and turn it into a "canonical"
nbviewer URL. See the [dropbox provider](./nbviewer/providers/dropbox/handlers.py)
for a simple example of rewriting URLs without using a custom API client.

##### `default_handlers`
If you need custom logic, such as connecting to an API, implement
`default_handlers`. See the [github provider](./nbviewer/providers/github/handlers.py)
for a complex example of providing multiple handlers.

##### Error Handling
While you _could_ re-implement upstream HTTP error handling, a small
convenience method is provided for intercepting HTTP errors.
On a given URL handler that inherits from `BaseHandler`, overload the
`client_error_message` and re-call it with your message (or `None`). See the
[gist provider](./nbviewer/providers/gist/handlers.py) for an example of customizing the
error message.

### Formats
Formats are ways to present notebooks to the user.

`nbviewer` ships with three providers:
- `html`
- `slides`
- `script`

#### Writing a new Format
If you'd like to write a new format, open a ticket, or speak up on [gitter][]!
We have some work yet to do to support your next big thing in notebook
publishing, and we'd love to here from you.

## Securing the Notebook Viewer

You can run the viewer as a [JupyterHub 0.7+ service](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services.html). Running the viewer as a service prevents users who have not authenticated with the Hub from acccessing the nbviewer instance. This setup can be useful for protecting access to local notebooks rendered with the `--localfiles` option.

Add an entry like the following to your `jupyterhub_config.py` to have it start nbviewer as a managed service:

```python
c.JupyterHub.services = [
    {
        # the /services/<name> path for accessing the notebook viewer
        'name': 'nbviewer',
        # the interface and port nbviewer will use
        'url': 'http://127.0.0.1:9000',
        # the path to nbviewer repo
        'cwd': '<path to repo>',
        # command to start the nbviewer
        'command': ['python', '-m', 'nbviewer']
    }
]
```

The nbviewer instance will automatically read the [various `JUPYTERHUB_*` environment variables](http://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/services.html#launching-a-hub-managed-service) and configure itself accordingly. You can also run the nbviewer instance as an [externally managed JupyterHub service](http://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/services.html#externally-managed-services), but must set the requisite environment variables yourself.
