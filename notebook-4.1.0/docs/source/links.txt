.. This (-*- rst -*-) format file contains commonly used link targets
   and name substitutions.  It may be included in many files,
   therefore it should only contain link targets and name
   substitutions.  Try grepping for "^\.\. _" to find plausible
   candidates for this list.

   NOTE: this file must have an extension *opposite* to that of the main reST
   files in the manuals, so that we can include it with ".. include::"
   directives, but without triggering warnings from Sphinx for not being listed
   in any toctree.  Since IPython uses .txt for the main files, this one will
   use .rst.

   NOTE: reST targets are
   __not_case_sensitive__, so only one target definition is needed for
   ipython, IPython, etc.

   NOTE: Some of these were taken from the nipy links compendium.
