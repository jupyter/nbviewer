- Added *Restart & Run All* to the *Kernel* menu. Users can also bind it to a keyboard shortcut on action ``restart-kernel-and-run-all-cells``.
- Added multiple-cell selection. Users press ``Shift-Up/Down`` or ``Shift-K/J`` to extend selection in command mode. Various actions such as cut/copy/paste, execute, and cell type conversions apply to all selected cells.

Other improvements:

- Added tags to ``jupyter/notebook`` releases on DockerHub. ``latest`` continues to track the master branch.
